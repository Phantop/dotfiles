# July's Dotfiles

These are the dots I use on all of my computers.

Currently, I primarily run:
- Arch Linux
- Budgie Desktop
- X11

Notable items in this repo:
- `bin/minecraft`: barebones downloader + launcher in POSIX sh
- `bin/setup`: setup script, getting additional configuration data and installing software
- `bin/wallmanip`: wallpaper manipulation script; can pad or crop images with various effects and positionings
- `dconf`: my Budgie panel layout
- `dracula.reg`: Wine Dracula colorscheme
- `gtk-3.0`: Budgie titlebar removal and workspace panel adjustments
- `qt5ct`: qt5 Dracula colorscheme
- `qutebrowser/redirects.py`: redirection intercepts for various privacy-respecting website frontends, based on the config [here](https://gitlab.com/jgkamat/dotfiles/-/blob/master/qutebrowser/.config/qutebrowser/pyconfig/redirectors.py)
